Hi,

This is a quiz app that I have designed from scratch.
This is a single page site, and the contents are changed by DOM manipulation technique, hiding and showing different contents.
The main data for quiz is stored as an Array of objects with questions, options, correct answers, screenshots if any.
Score is stored on local storage, this is not necessary now. I think this will help me in future releases. If I made so.
Quiz Content: This is mainly taken from LinkedIn Skill Assessment as I found all very intersting challenging our knoweldge
